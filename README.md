# AppTracker

Staying organised when applying for a job is not easy. Trying to keep up with all your different applications can be stressful without the right tool. That is where AppTracker comes in.

It is perfect for students who are applying for internships and graduate roles, and for those seeking full time employment. This app saves you the time and hassle, so that you can focus on acing your interviews. 

AppTracker allows you to find exactly what you are looking for with ease. 
- SEARCH applications by the company name or role
- SORT applications by salary
- FILTER applications with specific stages or status

You will never have to forget any detail about a job application. AppTracker allows you to save details about an application like the length, location, and salary.

Add notes to both the application and the stages, so you can store additional details like:
- the research about a company
- the online application stage requires a CV and Cover Letter
- the interview stage has a business casual dress code

Set a job application as high priority, allowing you to know which job application needs your attention, and is important to you right now.

You will no longer need to worry about tracking all your job applications on your own; AppTracker is all you need.
